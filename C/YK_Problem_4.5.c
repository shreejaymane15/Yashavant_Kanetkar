/*A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following contidions:
(i) Hardness must be grater than 5.0.
(ii)Carbon content must be less than 0.7.
(iii)Tensile strength must be greater than 5600.
The grades are as follows:
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met.
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.
Grade is 8 if consitions (ii) and (iii) are met. 
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met.
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met.
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met.
Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under
consideration and output the grade of steel. */
